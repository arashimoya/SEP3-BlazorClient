Server crashes sometimes randomly and when rerunning the client
Unhandled exception. Unhandled exception. System.IO.IOException: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host..
 ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (10054): An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.


When trying to restart the server while the client is running, sometimes the compiler fails to build server project: 
    (Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(4965, 5): [MSB3021] Unable to copy file "C:\Users\arasi\RiderProjects\SEP3\ABDOT\ABDOTClient\obj\Debug\net5.0\apphost.exe" to "bin\Debug\net5.0\ABDOTClient.exe". The process cannot access the file 'C:\Users\arasi\RiderProjects\SEP3\ABDOT\ABDOTClient\bin\Debug\net5.0\ABDOTClient.exe' because it is being used by another process.)
